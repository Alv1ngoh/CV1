          <p>Hi, I'm Alvin the problem solver.I come from Singapore, a city-state located in South East Asia. I am now based in Sydney. Before my journey to UX, I worked in the legal industry. I also co-founded two mobile apps which drove my passion and desire to become a UX designer.
            I love solving problems. First with numbers as an engineering student, then with words as a lawyer and now with my designs. I also code to build apps for fun!
            In my free time, I enjoy playing golf and football. I also love reading non-fiction books.</p></td>
